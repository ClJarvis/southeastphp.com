                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>Southeast PHP was formed by the organizers of the Nashville PHP Meetup who wanted to provide a conference for PHP developers in the South Eastern United States and abroad. Currently, the Southeast does not host a regional PHP conference, even though there are lots of PHP developers. Southeast PHP was born to serve this community and to help connect it with the worldwide PHP community by giving regional developers a chance to connect with each other and the broader PHP community.</p>

                    <h3>What Is Southeast PHP?</h3>
                    <p>Southeast PHP is a multi-track PHP conference providing developers at any stage in their careers a chance to learn something new. 2018 will focus on tools and technologies the Modern PHP developer needs to have in his or her tell-belt. Sessions will be organized into tracks and will include the following topics, security, frameworks, libraries, new PHP features, Javascript, design patterns, databases, and everything else the Modern PHP Developer should know.</p>
                    <h3>When & Where</h3>
                    <p>The first Southeast PHP will happen in August of 2018 at <a href="http://www.hotelpreston.com/">Hotel Preston</a> in Nashville, TN. <a href="http://www.hotelpreston.com/">Hotel Preston</a> is between the airport and downtown. Nashville is a great ciy to visit and the venue provides easy access to attractions. For a list of things to do, you can vist the <a href="/#/nashville">Nashville</a> page.</p>

                    <h3>Why Attend?</h3>

                    <p>Youâ€™ll get to learn from and alongside a diverse group of developers from all over the world and of all skill levels.
